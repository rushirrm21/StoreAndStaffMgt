1. Please find the Case Study 2 Word file that contains the description/documentation of the USE CASE.

2. The Files to upload folder contains the files that I have uploaded to the application while testing it. Please have the file strcuture according to it for
	smooth functioning of the application.

3. The Testing Files Junit contains the files that are required for junit testing as thids files contains some valid and invalid data for it testing these
	files were used. Please check that path of this files while you are running the junit in the test files.

4 The Implemented code contains the Frontend and Backend code.

	4.1 Front_End
		
		4.1.1  For running the front end have vs code configured for React JS applications.

		4.1.2 Import the folder of frontend->ssm into vs code and after successfull importing type command npm start and the application will start.
	
		4.1.3 For accessing the api please check the port number in the url given in app.js file. Currently its configure to run on 8080. If you are 
			changing port number in backend then only you need to change otherwise keeping it the same in front end and backend will smoothly run
			 the application.
	
	4.2 Back_End

		4.2.1 Import the folder Back_End->CSV_DB into your prefferd IDE. I have used Spring Tool Suite.

		4.2.2 After importing run the application from menu Run As->Spring Boot Application.

		4.2.3 If you want to change port number you can change it from application.proprties file, But if are changing it then do change in the Front End
			 also for accessing the API.

		4.2.4 Have Sonar Lint configured to analyse sonar fixes.

		4.2.5 Can check code coverage from Coverage->Junit.

Thank you !
